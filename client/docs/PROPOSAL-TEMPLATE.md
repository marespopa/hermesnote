# Proposal Template - Upwork

## 1. Restate their core problem.
In this example, after a quick “Hello!” restate the customer’s problem to them using their own words. “I see that you need help offloading and upgrading some of your financial processes in your growing business.”

## 2. Tell them you can help solve their problem, and that you can start right away.
This is the only section of my proposal that rarely changes. Literally tell them “I can help you with that, and can start right away”. The key here is that the client is looking for someone to help with a problem they’re having. They want a solution, and they want it fast. By telling them you want to help them and that you can get started right away, you’re providing a vision of a solution on the horizon, and that’s what they want.

## 3. Tell them why you’re a good fit
Next, write two or three sentences on why you’re a good fit. It doesn’t need to be lengthy for the sake of being lengthy. Concisely tell them why you’re the best fit.

## 4. Describe the process you’ll guide them through
This is the section that ranges the most for me. Depending on how specific the requirements were in the job posting, spend anywhere from two sentences to two paragraphs explaining the path you’ll guide them down. Give them a glimpse into the process that you’re going to walk them through. If you’re going to elaborate on any of the sections of your proposal, I think this is where you can get away with a little bulk. Tell them the first few steps you’d go through with them.

## 5. Attachments
A well designed and well documented onboarding process, or example will go a long way in building your credibility.
