# User Journey

_After authentication and account creation,_

## 1. User starts at the dashboard page, showing 'You have no projects and no clients yet.'

## 2. Option to add a client. Define:

- client name
- client business
- client email
- client phone
- client timezone

## 3. Option to add projects/client

- project name
- delivarables (text)
- timeline (when does it need to be done)
- tasks to be done, so we can export a PDF report with the status
- task / todo / in progress / done (a simple table for now)

## 4. User is switched back to dashboard view

- all the current clients and each client entry should have an expand option to show the projects
