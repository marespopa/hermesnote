          At HermesNotes, I&apos;m all about simplifying Markdown for everyone.
          That&apos;s why HermesNotes is as a free tool. I get how Markdown can
          be a bit tricky, and I want to help you out without charging a dime.

          I&apos;ve been using HermesNotes myself to make my Markdown work
          easier. Now, I&apos;m thrilled to share it with you. HermesNotes will
          always be 100% free because I think Markdown should be hassle-free for
          all.
