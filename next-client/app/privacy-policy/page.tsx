        <h2>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

        <p>We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.”</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> includes information that
            cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage
            data, general demographic information, referring/exit pages and
            URLs, platform types, preferences you submit, and preferences that
            are generated based on your submitted data and number of clicks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal Information</strong> includes your IP Address.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1. Information Collected via Technology</h3>
        <p>
          To activate the Service, you do not need to submit any Personal
          Information other than your IP Address. However, in an effort to
          improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided by
          your browser or our software application when you view or use the
          Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring
          URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you
          connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other
          information that does not personally identify you.
        </p>

        <p>
          We track this information using cookies, which are small text files
          that include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a
          user's browser from our servers and are stored on the user's computer
          hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user's browser enables us to collect
          Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the
          user's preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual
          and aggregate basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent
          cookies remain on your computer after you close your session until you
          delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Children's Privacy</h3>

          13. The Site does not knowingly collect or solicit information from
          anyone under the age of 13, nor does it allow anyone under the age of
          13 to sign up for the Service. If we learn that we have collected
          personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without the
          consent of a parent or guardian, we will delete that information as
          soon as possible. If you believe we have collected such information,
          please contact us at{" "}
          <a href="mailto:office@marespopa.com">office@marespopa.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Personal Information:</strong> Except as otherwise stated in
          this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share
          your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We
          share Personal Information with vendors performing services for the
          Company, such as servers for our email communications. These vendors
          use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance
          with our Privacy Policy. Generally, the Personal Information you
          provide to us is used to help us communicate with you, including
          contacting users in response to questions, soliciting feedback,
          providing technical support, and informing users about promotional
          offers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a
          good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the
          information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal
          process or enforceable governmental request, enforce applicable Terms
          of Service, address fraud, security or technical concerns, or protect
          against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the
          public as required or permitted by law.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> We use Non-Personal
          Information to improve the Service and customize the user experience.
          We also aggregate Non-Personal Information to track trends and analyze
          usage patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit our use
          or disclosure of Non-Personal Information; we reserve the right to use
          and disclose such information to our partners, advertisers, and other
          third parties at our discretion.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the event of a business transaction, such as a merger or
          acquisition, your Personal Information may be among the assets
          transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur
          and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and any acquirer of our
          assets may continue to process your Personal Information as outlined
          in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change in the
          future, we will post the policy changes on the Site so you may opt out
          of the new information practices. We recommend checking the Site
          periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.
        </p>

        <h2>III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</h2>

        <p>
          We implement security measures designed to protect your information
          from unauthorized access. Your account is protected by your password,
          and we urge you to take steps to keep your information safe by not
          disclosing your password and logging out of your account after each
          use. We further protect your information from potential security
          breaches by implementing technological measures including encryption,
          firewalls, and secure socket layer technology. However, these measures
          do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed,
          disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and
          secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you
          understand and agree to assume these risks.
        </p>

        <h2>IV. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2>

        <p>
          As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with
          other websites or applications. However, we are not responsible for
          the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or
          content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to
          information collected by us through the Site and the Service.
          Therefore, it does not apply to your use of a third-party website
          accessed via a link on our Site or Service. If you access or use the
          Service through another website or application, the privacy policy of
          that site will apply to your use of that site or application. We
          encourage users to read the privacy statements of other websites
          before proceeding to use them.
        </p>

        <h2>V. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

        <p>
          The Company reserves the right to change this policy and our Terms of
          Service at any time. We will notify you of significant changes to our
          Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the primary email address
          specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our
          site. Significant changes will take effect 30 days following such
